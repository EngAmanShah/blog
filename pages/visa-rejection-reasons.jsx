            <p className="m-0">
              <strong>Reason for Rejection:</strong> Inadequate financial
              documentation, leading to visa denial when performing a MOI Qatar
              visa check.
            </p>
            <p className="m-0">

          <li className="mb-4">
            <h3 className="mb-2 text-danger">Prior Offenses</h3>
            <p className="m-0">
              <strong>Reason for Rejection:</strong> Having a criminal record or
              prior offenses often appears during visa verification steps, like
              a QID check.
            </p>
            <p className="m-0">

            <h3 className="mb-2 text-danger">Invalid Passport</h3>
            <p className="m-0">
              <strong>Reason for Rejection:</strong> An expired passport or
